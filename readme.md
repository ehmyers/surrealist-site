Surrealistically Styled Site
===================================
Emily Myers

This website is designed to be a site about surrealism, in the style of surrealism, that acts like surrealism.  It was created for New Media 320, which is Intermediate Interactive Design at UNC Asheville during my senior year.  The menu text is in a style similar to Mondrian's script style from _The Treachery of Images_, and the text at the bottom is a nod to that piece.  The overall feel of this piece is meant to evoke a sort of dream-like feel, with the backgrounds slowly auto-scrolling into chaos.
